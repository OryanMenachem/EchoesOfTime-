    <h2>What Still Matters Today</h2>
    <p>
      Today, Braille is used all over the world by blind and visually impaired
      people. It is written in many languages, and it helps millions of people
      learn, read, and live more freely.
    </p>

    <p>
      Braille signs are used in elevators, public places, medicine bottles, and
      more. Louis Brailleâ€™s idea changed lives and gave power to people who were
      once left out. Even after more than 150 years, his system is still
      important.
    </p>

    <p>
      His story teaches us that even a young person, with a big problem and a
      small idea, can create something that helps the world. That message still
      matters today.
