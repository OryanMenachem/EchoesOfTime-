        <summary>Read more about his childhood accident</summary>
        When he was just three years old, he had a terrible accident. He was
        playing in his fatherâ€™s workshop and hurt his eye with a sharp tool. The
        wound got infected, and soon he became blind in both eyes.

      Even though he was blind, Louis was very smart and wanted to learn.

      But at school, he found it very hard to read.

        wanted to change that.
